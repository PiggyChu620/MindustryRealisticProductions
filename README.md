# Mindustry Java Mod - Realistic Materials/Resources/Alloys/Products/Compounds 0.1
A Java Mindustry mod.

A collection of realistic materials, resources, alloys, products, and compounds.
It is designed to be as close to real-life procedure and realistic as possible, it's for those who don't mind designing complicated net of supply chains, it's REALLY complicated, you have been warned!
I squeeze all productions into a single *Chemical Plant*, mostly because spriting is not my forte, just making this *Chemical Plant* have given me a good beating.
New stuff will be constantly added.

**Because some of the main ingredients require resources from both Serpulo and Erekir, so this mod only works on Sandboxes or Mixtech mods.**
